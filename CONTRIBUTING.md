# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

Currently, this is a one-woman project.

There is TypeScript, Prettier and ESLint that catch most common coding pitfalls.
Apart from that, there are no strict coding conventions.

The only prerequisite is to follow the Code of Conduct.

Feel free to fork and help improving the project by creating a pull request.

Don't be shy. Aside to code changes, help improving the documentation,
this contribution guideline or the description of open issues is highly appreciated.

Cheers,

Lea
