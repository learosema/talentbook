# Talentbook frontend

This is a react application, initially created with `create-react-app` and then I switched to [parceljs](https://parceljs.org) because I wasn't fully satisfied by the configuration choices made by `create-react-app`.

## Setup

- You can run `npm install` here, but it is not needed if you have run `npm run bootstrap` in the root folder
- `npm start` runs a development server on http://localhost:1234/
- `npm run storybook` runs a storybook on http://localhost:9009/
